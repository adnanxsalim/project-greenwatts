# GreenWatts: Rewarding Green Choices, Powering a Sustainable Future.
This platform utilizes blockchain technology to incentivize green energy production and consumption.  Imagine a system where users are rewarded for generating solar power or simply using less energy.  The core concept involves a secure digital ledger (blockchain) that tracks energy usage and sources.  Renewable energy producers and efficient consumers earn tokens or points for their green actions.  These tokens can then be used for various purposes, potentially including purchasing electricity, receiving discounts from eco-conscious businesses, or even trading on an open market.  This approach aims to create a win-win situation:  individuals are rewarded for green choices, and the overall transition to renewable energy is accelerated.
